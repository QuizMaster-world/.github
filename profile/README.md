# Welcome to the World of QuizMaster!

![](Images/Logo.png)

Welcome to the QuizMaster World! We are a dedicated team of developers, educators, and quiz enthusiasts committed to creating the best open-source quiz platform and tools. We are using this organisation as a version for the public, while our main development is happening on [hermonochy's](https://github.com/hermonochy) account.

## Our Projects

### QuizMaster App

- [***QuizMaster App***](https://github.com/QuizMaster-world/QuizMaster) is our flagship project - a powerful and flexible quiz application that allows users to create, and play quizzes on various topics, in various ways! It features a user-friendly interface, real-time scoring, and customizable window themes.

- **Key Benefits**:
  - The richest in features (By far!).
  - User-friendly interface designed for seamless navigation.
  - Real-time scoring to enhance the competitive experience.
  - Customizable window themes that allow users to personalize their experience.
  - Quick Startup of QuizCreator.

### QuizMasterMini

- [***QuizMasterMini***](https://github.com/QuizMaster-world/QuizMasterMini) is a smaller version of QuizMaster - but still with a GUI. While rich in features, QuizMaster App requires high storage capabilities and processing power, so we have created a  lightweight alternative, just 8 MB in size and comes with no dependencies, ensuring accessibility for all!

- **Key Benefits**:
  - Only 8 MB in size, making it quick to download and install.
  - No additional dependencies required, simplifying installation.
  - Retains essential quiz functionalities, ensuring a satisfying user experience.

### QuizMasterTerminal

- [***QuizMasterTerminal***](https://github.com/QuizMaster-world/QuizMasterTerminal) is an even smaller version of QuizMasterMini. While it lacks a graphical user interface, it still delivers an efficient quizzing experience for users preferring command-line interactions.

- **Key Benefits**:
  - Minimal size of just 1.4 MB.
  - Ideal for developers and users who prefer command-line tools.
  - Enables quick access to quizzes without the overhead of graphical components.
  
### MicroQuizMaster
- [***MicroQuizMaster***](https://github.com/QuizMaster-world/MicroQuizMaster) is our very smallest project, only 8 KB big! Similar to QuizMasterTerminal, this version contains no example quizzes and is the only MIT licenced repository. It targets users with the very weakest devices, **especially** Windows users.

### QuizMasterPaper

- [***QuizMasterPaper***](https://github.com/QuizMaster-world/QuizMasterPaper) offers a printable version of quizzes that can be used in offline or classroom settings, given in either PDF or TXT form. While this project doesn't offer an interactive quiz game, the quiz creator can still utilize the JSON format found in our other repositories.

- **Features**:
  - Perfect for school teachers.
  - Allows quiz creators to use the JSON formats from our other repositories.

### QuizMaster-web

- **QuizMaster-web** is currently still in its early stages of development, but will soon become a web-app version of QuizMaster App.
