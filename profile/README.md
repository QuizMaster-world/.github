# Welcome to the World of QuizMaster!

Welcome to the QuizMaster World! We are a dedicated team of developers, educators, and quiz enthusiasts committed to creating the best open-source quiz platform and tools. We are using this organisation as a version for the public, while our main development is happening on [hermonochy's](https://github.com/hermonochy) account.

## Our Projects

### QuizMaster App

- [***QuizMaster App***](https://github.com/QuizMaster-world/QuizMaster) is our flagship project - a powerful and flexible quiz application that allows users to create, and play quizzes on various topics, in various ways! It features a user-friendly interface, real-time scoring, and customizable window themes.

### QuizMasterLite

- [***QuizMasterLite***](https://github.com/QuizMaster-world/QuizMasterLite) is a smaller version of QuizMaster - but still with a GUI. Some players may be on a budget with storage capabilities or processing power, so we have created a seperate repository as a smaller version, totalling only 8 MB and with no dependencies!

### QuizMasterTerminal

- [***QuizMasterTerminal***](https://github.com/QuizMaster-world/QuizMasterTerminal) is an even smaller version of QuizMasterLite. However, while it totals only 1.4 MB of storage, there is no GUI, and it is purely run via terminal.

### MicroQuizMaster
- [***MicroQuizMaster***](https://github.com/QuizMaster-world/MicroQuizMaster) is our very smallest project, only 7 KB big! Similar to QuizMasterTerminal, this version contains no example quizzes and is the only MIT licenced repository. It targets users with the very weakest devices, **especially** Windows users.

### QuizMasterPaper

- [***QuizMasterPaper***](https://github.com/QuizMaster-world/QuizMasterPaper) offers a printable version of quizzes that can be used in offline or classroom settings, given in either PDF or TXT. Unlike the other repositories, there is no quiz game but the quizcreator can still read the json format present in other repos.


### QuizMaster-web

- **QuizMaster-web** is currently still in its early stages of development, but will soon become a web-app version of QuizMaster App.
